# BattleshipGameES50
## Information
This is the code for the Battleship Game that Aida Baradari, Arseniy Zvyagintsev, and Lana Wagner did for our final project of the course ES50: Introduction to Electrical Engineering. 

This folder contains the multiple files we used for making our project work - the four files, are for each Arduino used in the project. As you will see when you open the code, each arduino will be given an ID at the very beginning of the code. This is to make the communication between the four Arduinos work. The code of the notepads will be similiar to each other, as well as the code of the two displays. The major differences will be the numbers and addresses of the code but the logic basically stays the same.
